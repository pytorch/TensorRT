        "\n\n# Engine Caching\n\nAs model sizes increase, the cost of compilation will as well. With AOT methods\nlike ``torch.dynamo.compile``, this cost is paid upfront. However if the weights\nchange, the session ends or you are using JIT methods like ``torch.compile``, as\ngraphs get invalidated they get re-compiled, this cost will get paid repeatedly.\nEngine caching is a way to mitigate this cost by saving constructed engines to disk\nand re-using them when possible. This tutorial demonstrates how to use engine caching\nwith TensorRT in PyTorch. Engine caching can significantly speed up subsequent model\ncompilations reusing previously built TensorRT engines.\n\nWe'll explore two approaches:\n\n    1. Using torch_tensorrt.dynamo.compile\n    2. Using torch.compile with the TensorRT backend\n\nThe example uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model and shows the\ndifferences between compilation without caching, with caching enabled,\nand when reusing cached engines.\n"

        "## Engine Caching for JIT Compilation\n\nThe primary goal of engine caching is to help speed up JIT workflows. ``torch.compile``\nprovides a great deal of flexibility in model construction which makes it a good\nfirst tool to try when looking to speed up your workflow. However, historically\nthe cost of compilation and in particular recompilation has been a barrier to entry\nfor many users. If for some reason a subgraph gets invalidated, that graph is reconstructed\nscratch prior to the addition of engine caching. Now as engines are constructed, with ``cache_built_engines=True``,\nengines are saved to disk tied to a hash of their corresponding PyTorch subgraph. If\nin a subsequent compilation, either as part of this session or a new session, the cache will\npull the built engine and **refit** the weights which can reduce compilation times by orders of magnitude.\nAs such, in order to insert a new engine into the cache (i.e. ``cache_built_engines=True``),\nthe engine must be refitable (``make_refittable=True``). See `refit_engine_example` for more details.\n\n"
